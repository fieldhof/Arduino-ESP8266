# Arduino-ESP8266

This is a little project I made to read a couple of temperatures.
These temps are posted to thingspeak and displayed on a lcd screen.

<h2>Installation</h2>
To connect to a WiFi spot put your SSID and password in the correct place.<br>
Also your API key has to be inserted in the correct place.<br>
If you have more channels or fields at thingspeak you have to change the GET request.
